<h1>Gradient Descent Algorithm From Scratch</h1>
<h3>A simple implementation of Gradient Descent Algorithm from scratch</h3>
<p>
  <b>Gradient Descent</b> is an optimization-based approach for estimating the parameters of a linear regression model.
  <br>
  <b>Definition:</b> Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used for finding the minimum of a function. It's widely used in machine learning and deep learning for      training models. The basic idea behind gradient descent is to take steps in the direction of the steepest decrease in the function, i.e., in the direction of the negative gradient.
  <br>
  <b>Objective:</b> Given a function f(x) that we want to minimize (Loss function/Cost function), gradient descent aims to find the value of x that minimizes f(x).
